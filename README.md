# identify face and send email
This project implements a smart hostel gate system that uses face recognition to identify students and an alcohol sensor to detect alcohol consumption. If alcohol is detected, an alert email is automatically sent to the student’s parents

Components Required:
Arduino Uno – to interface with the alcohol sensor and send signals to the computer.
MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor – to detect alcohol presence in the student's breath.
Webcam – for capturing student faces for recognition.
Laptop/PC – to run the face recognition and email alert system.
Python (with OpenCV and SMTP libraries) – for face detection, recognition, and sending emails.
Jumper wires – for connecting components.
USB cable – to connect Arduino to the laptop.
